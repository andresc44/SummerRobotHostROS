# SummerRobotHostROS

These are all the files that were saved locally as part of the src folder of the ROS Master computer in the summer project. A lot of these are tutorials and extra libraries I downloaded at the time. inside the raspi_robot directory is the important code. 

The other half of this project's code is stored on the sd card from the raspberry pi.

The arduino code is stored locally on Windows. Should be committed in the near future.
